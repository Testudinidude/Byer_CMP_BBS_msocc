## Description of the data and file structure

Several datasets are provided for ease of analysis.

CMP_bbs_obsdata.csv: Each row of the provided dataset is a separate observation of a bird species during point count surveys; bird common names and 4-digit species codes are provided in column F and G; distance bins at which birds were observed are provided in column E (as either > 50 m or <=50 m). Details on the survey date and observer names are provided in columns B and C, respectively. The simp_plot column (column A) designates the unique, 4-digit code assigned to each Plant Community Assessment Program (PCAP) plot. When sufficient plot-level vegetation and landscape data were available for date ranges matching the bird community survey years (2017-2021), these data were appended as rows H - AH. Users will note that some rows have "missing data" (#N/A) in place of vegetation and landscape data; these represent cases where insufficient data were available for formal analysis of occupancy. These rows are still provided for the sake of data completeness.

CMP_bbs_summary.csv: Similar to CMP_bbs_obsdata, but summarized by site. In this case, occupancy states for each bird species are assessed across all replicate surveys at each site (0 = unobserved, 1 = observed).

BBSMigrants.csv: Species names, abbreviations, numbers of detections, and migratory statuses for bird species expected in Northeast Ohio.

comm_plotting.csv: Community-level and migratory group-level covariate estimates for the top multispecies occupancy model.

sppplotting.csv: Species-level covariate estimates, extracted from the top multispecies occupancy model.

## Sharing/Access information

Data was derived largely from surveys and mapping products generated by Cleveland Metroparks, with the exception of ldi_3k, dev, and dev_edge; these three covariates were derived from the National Land Cover Database, which can be accessed below:

## Code/Software

Code for the majority of analyses in the manuscript are provided in bbs_cmp_bin_justms_sub.Rmd. This code was generate using R version 4.3.1.
